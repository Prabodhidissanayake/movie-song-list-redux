# Movie-Song List

## Description

The **Movie-Song List** project is a web application designed to facilitate the learning of Redux Toolkit. It allows users to create and manage a list of movies and songs. By simply clicking the "Add" button, users can generate random names for movies and songs, which are then added to separate lists. The application provides an intuitive interface for viewing the lists and removing individual items by utilizing the close button associated with each title. Additionally, a reset button is available at the top of the page to quickly clear all items from the lists.
